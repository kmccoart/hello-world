Learning to use Git

A little about me...I am a full time engineer and dad to 3 beautiful little girls.  They range in age from 5, 3 and 10 weeks old.  I'm not sure any of them will be into gaming or programming, so I like to spend some of my free time coding and gaming.  I'm trying to learn Git to be able to work on projects with other people.
